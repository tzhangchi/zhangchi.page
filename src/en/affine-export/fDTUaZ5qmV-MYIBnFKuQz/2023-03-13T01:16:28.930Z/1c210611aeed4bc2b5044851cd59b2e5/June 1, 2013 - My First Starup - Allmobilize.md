One line of code to adapt your website is a very good opportunity, ninety-nine percent of the world's websites may then develop and maintain a mobile site is a very challenging thing, this is my first entrepreneurial journey

I also became a member of Microsoft Azure Accelerator,The 3 months I spent in Microsoft office at that time showed me the employee culture of the global giant Microsoft, the excellent engineer culture, which also influenced my love for technology and the importance of a good company to the company's culture is extremely important. The intuition to find a company that values engineers was also generated, and I am thankful that I was deeply influenced by Microsoft's culture when I graduated.
