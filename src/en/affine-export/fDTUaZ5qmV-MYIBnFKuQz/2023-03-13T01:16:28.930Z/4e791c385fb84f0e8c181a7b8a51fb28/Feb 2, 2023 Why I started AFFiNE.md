First, **to the future ,to the horizon**,  I want to make products that are valuable to global users, which represents the direction of **globalization**, to provide SaaS products that serve the global scope

Second,  **adventure**,  Imaginative and innovative technologies are often very challenging, the more participants are needed. Gather the best engineers in the world to promote its development through** innovation and enthusiasm**, and build a very** large ecosystem** of sustainable development. In this respect, I need to salute and learn from Linus Benedict Torvalds, must adhere to long-termism

Third, **won't  be afraid of failure**, three years ago I was in charge of the online documentation product in China's most leading short video platform Kuaishou, when the docs code was based on the google docs product prototype and technical architecture reference to design, has been iterating for nearly a decade, I have just joined a team of 40 senior engineers, none of whom has ever proposed to become a leader. Lead a reconstruction plan to reconstruct the whole project through safe and reliable static language, the development of **cross-platform local-first database Taco** and completely centralized document and table **calculation engine** **into the client side implementation**, finally, I think I can do it, all the results also by me to bear

In the end, after I had delivered on all my technical promises successfully, I left Kuaishou and became an entrepreneur again, choosing to build tech infra and the global **collaboration** **software** **AFFiNE** [https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE)** through open source**.

[AFFiNE](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE) is a **next-gen knowledge base** that brings** planning, sorting and creating** all together. **Privacy first, open-source,** customizable and ready to use, built with [BlockSuite](https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite) and [Octobase](https://github.com/toeverything/OctoBase) to ensure consistency and accessibility on Mac, Windows and Linux. We want your data always to be yours, without any sacrifice to your accessibility. **Your data is always stored local first,** with full support for **real-time collaboration** through peer-to-peer technology. We don't think "_**privacy-first**_" is a good excuse for not supporting modern web features. And when it comes to collaboration, these features are not just necessarily for teams - you can take and insert pictures on your phone, edit them from your desktop, and then share them with your collaborators.

Tech infra includes the** open-source collaborative editor **[https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite](https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite)  and ** local-first database** [https://github.com/toeverything/OctoBase](https://github.com/toeverything/OctoBase), they would be implemented by **typescript** , **rust** and _WebAssembly(_**Wasm**_), **Products using these technology infrastructures can run their software on any device, any terminal, and users can own their data**_
